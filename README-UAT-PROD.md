# UAT and PROD Certificates

## DigiCert Account

To request UAT and PROD certificates, you need to have an account with
DigiCert where you can manage your certificates and requests.

If you do not have an account, you can create one on the [DigiCert website](https://www.digicert.com/account/signup/).

## Requesting UAT and PROD Certificates

Once you have an account, you need to request access to the X9 certificates. This
can typically be done by contacting DigiCert support or your account manager.

Once you have access, you can request UAT and PROD certificates through the DigiCert
portal.
